# Coinbase Ticker Analyzer - Implementation Steps

## Project Overview
This C++ application subscribes to Coinbase ticker data via WebSockets, calculates Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs), and logs the data to CSV files. The implementation follows object-oriented principles with multithreading for performance.

## Architecture Overview
- **Main Application**: CoinbaseTickerAnalyzer orchestrates all components
- **WebSocket Client**: Handles real-time connection to Coinbase
- **JSON Parser**: Processes incoming ticker messages
- **EMA Calculator**: Calculates 5-second interval EMAs for price and mid-price
- **CSV Logger**: Thread-safe logging to CSV files
- **Data Structure**: TickerData holds all ticker information and calculated values

## Implementation Steps Completed

### 1. Project Structure Setup
- Created CMakeLists.txt with C++17 standard
- Set up third-party library dependencies (WebSocket++, nlohmann/json)
- Configured build system for cross-platform compatibility
- Added Doxygen documentation generation support

### 2. Core Data Structure (TickerData)
- Defined comprehensive ticker data structure with all Coinbase fields
- Added calculated fields for EMAs and mid-price
- Implemented CSV export functionality with proper escaping
- Added timestamp handling for internal processing

### 3. EMA Calculator (EMACalculator)
- Implemented thread-safe EMA calculations
- Used 5-second interval as specified in requirements
- Applied proper smoothing factor: alpha = 2/(n+1) where n=5
- Added time-based update logic to prevent excessive calculations
- Used atomic variables for thread safety

### 4. WebSocket Client (WebSocketClient)
- Integrated WebSocket++ library for real-time connections
- Implemented connection management with proper error handling
- Added message callback system for asynchronous data processing
- Created subscription functionality for Coinbase ticker channels
- Used separate I/O thread for non-blocking operations

### 5. JSON Parser (JSONParser)
- Implemented robust JSON parsing using nlohmann/json library
- Added validation for ticker message types
- Handled missing fields gracefully with default values
- Created subscription message generation
- Added timestamp parsing for ISO 8601 format

### 6. CSV Logger (CSVLogger)
- Implemented thread-safe CSV logging
- Added automatic header generation
- Implemented proper CSV field escaping for special characters
- Used file buffering for performance
- Added flush functionality for immediate data persistence

### 7. Main Application (CoinbaseTickerAnalyzer)
- Orchestrated all components with proper initialization
- Implemented multithreaded data processing pipeline
- Added queue-based message handling for decoupling
- Created graceful shutdown mechanism
- Added statistics and monitoring capabilities

### 8. Multithreading Implementation
- **Main Thread**: Handles user input and application lifecycle
- **WebSocket I/O Thread**: Manages WebSocket connection and message reception
- **Data Processing Thread**: Processes ticker data and calculates EMAs
- **Thread Safety**: Used mutexes, condition variables, and atomic variables

### 9. Testing Framework
- Created comprehensive unit tests using Google Test
- Tested all major components individually
- Added thread safety tests
- Implemented integration test stubs
- Added performance and stress tests

### 10. Documentation
- Added Doxygen comments throughout the codebase
- Created comprehensive API documentation
- Documented all public interfaces and methods
- Added usage examples and implementation notes

## Key Features Implemented

### Performance Optimizations
- **Multithreading**: Separate threads for I/O and data processing
- **Lock-free Operations**: Used atomic variables where possible
- **Efficient Data Structures**: Queue-based message handling
- **Memory Management**: Smart pointers for automatic cleanup
- **File Buffering**: Optimized CSV writing with flush control

### Error Handling
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues operation despite individual message failures
- **Connection Recovery**: Proper WebSocket error handling
- **Data Validation**: JSON parsing with fallback values
- **Resource Cleanup**: RAII principles for automatic cleanup

### Thread Safety
- **Mutex Protection**: Critical sections properly protected
- **Condition Variables**: Efficient thread synchronization
- **Atomic Operations**: Lock-free access to shared data
- **Deadlock Prevention**: Careful lock ordering

## Build Instructions

### Prerequisites
- CMake 3.16 or higher
- C++17 compatible compiler (GCC 7+, Clang 5+, MSVC 2017+)
- Git (for fetching dependencies)

### Build Steps
```bash
# Create build directory
mkdir build && cd build
